    The name ‘Kodiveri’ originated from ‘kodivari’ meaning tiger in Tamil. This might be due to the presence of the dam in a forest area where a number of tigers lived.[1]
urali semba vettuva jeyangonda chola Kongalvan Vettuva Gounder King built the dam in the year 1125 AD. A 20-foot rock wall was carved out in order to build the dam. Iron bars were then used to interlock the stones, and lead was used as mortar. The small waterfall created by the flowing river water from the other side of the dam is purely a delight to the eyes.
     Due to non-availability of rocks in Kodiveri, rocks were quarried 
    from Kalkadampur (Kambatrayan Hill), 10 km north of Sathyamangalam. Skilled masons from Odisha, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh were brought in for the construction work.[5]</p>
